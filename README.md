# A Weather Component

This is a single file component to be used in other projects, adds an applet to show the weather conditions in the desired location.

To get the weather data, change the APIKEY to your own. You can get a free one from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).

There is a pure JavaScript version of this as well, you can find it in my other [repo](#).

To Do:
- Change the naming of elements to meaningful ones, generally clean the code
- Set a better CSS
- Using browser IP to locate default city
- Write the blog post about it
