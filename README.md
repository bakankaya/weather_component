# A Weather Component

![weather_app_Screenshot](./src/assets/weather_app.png)

Simple weather app made with JavaScript to show the weather conditions from the browser location or in the desired location.

The design is inspired from old digital watches *like Casio FW-91W*.

There is also pure JS version of it, which can be found at my other repo [weather_app](https://github.com/bakankaya/weather_app).

To use you need to get your own API keys from listed services (*for free*).
